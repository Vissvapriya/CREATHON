    <h1>Reducing Plastic Pollution: A Simple Solution for a Big Problem</h1>
    <p>Together, we can make a difference and reduce plastic waste.</p>

        <h2>The Problem with Plastic Pollution</h2>
        <p>Plastic pollution is one of the most pressing environmental issues today. Every year, millions of tons of plastic waste end up in landfills, rivers, and oceans, harming wildlife and ecosystems. To tackle this growing problem, we need to act together and make smarter choices.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Simple Solutions</h2>
        <p>The first step is to reduce how much plastic we use. Simple changes, like carrying reusable bags, bottles, and containers, can make a big difference. Instead of using single-use plastics, we can switch to eco-friendly materials like paper, glass, or biodegradable alternatives.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Recycling: An Essential Step</h2>
        <p>Recycling is another essential solution. Many plastics can be recycled, but this only works if we sort our waste properly. Governments and industries should also invest in better recycling systems and innovative technologies to process plastic waste more effectively.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Laws, Policies, and Awareness</h2>
        <p>Laws and policies can help too. Banning single-use plastics, encouraging companies to take responsibility for their plastic products, and taxing excessive plastic use can reduce pollution significantly. At the same time, awareness campaigns can educate people about the dangers of plastic pollution and inspire them to adopt greener habits.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Global Efforts and Innovative Technologies</h2>
        <p>Finally, global efforts like cleanups and using new technologies, such as turning plastic into fuel, can help us manage the plastic waste already out there. Together, we can reduce plastic pollution and create a healthier, cleaner world for future generations.</p>
